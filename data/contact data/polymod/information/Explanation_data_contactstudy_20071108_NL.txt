

The contactstudy was performed by Janneke Heijne; she also made the first data-delivery (september 2006).
Janneke now no longer works at the RIVM, but she has checked/cleaned/reorganised all the data of the study.
The translation and processing of the data was performed by Ben Bom (ben.bom@rivm.nl)


This data-delivery contains all the collected data, including the data allready delivered (sept 2006)
It exists of two text-files:
- Participants_20071108_NL.txt  (826 records)
- Contacts_20071108_NL.txt (11.221 records)


Remarks:
1) The "Dictionary for contact surveys - v1.1.doc" was used for naming & coding of the variables.
2) Some of the variables from the dictionary were not a part of our survey; these were omitted from the data-files.
(as before:)
3) In “participant_occupation”(paricipants) we added a new value label 7: disabled
4) In “diary_how”(participants) we added a new value label  4: day and evening
5) Regarding to "participant_edu_length"(participants) We tried to standardize our education level with the dictionary,
   but it was very hard. It resulted in the following:
	0: no formal schooling 
	1: primary school --> 8 years
	2: secondary school (lower) --> + 3-6 years
	3: secondary school (upper) --> + 5-6 years
	5: university degree (lower) --> + 4 years
	6: university degrees (higher) --> +6 years
